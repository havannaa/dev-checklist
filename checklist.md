# Quantum-Resistant Blockchain Development Checklist

This document outlines the tasks required to develop a quantum-resistant blockchain using the Substrate framework. The checklist is divided into sections to ensure a structured and organized development process.

## **1. Core Blockchain Development**

### **1.1 Consensus Mechanism**
- [ ] Implement Pure Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.
  - Validators are selected randomly from a pool of token holders.
  - Selection probability is proportional to the stake (token holdings) of each participant.
  - Minimal token holdings are required to participate in the validator selection process.
  - Ensure fairness and decentralization in the selection algorithm.
- [ ] Design and implement a secure and efficient randomized validator selection algorithm.
- [ ] Ensure minimal token holdings requirement for validators.
- [ ] Test and optimize the consensus mechanism for scalability and security.

### **1.2 Deflationary Mechanism**
- [ ] Implement transaction fee burning mechanism.
- [ ] Ensure 0.03% of the total supply is burned per transaction.
- [ ] Integrate the deflationary mechanism with the transaction processing logic.
- [ ] Test the deflationary mechanism for accuracy and efficiency.

### **1.3 Quantum Resistance**
- [ ] **Transaction Signing & Verification**
  - Replace ECDSA/ed25519 with quantum-resistant digital signatures (e.g., **CRYSTALS-Dilithium**, **FALCON**, or **SPHINCS+**).
  - Implement Dilithium or FALCON for efficiency in signing and verification.
  - Use SPHINCS+ for additional security where statefulness is not acceptable.
  - Modify Substrateâ€™s `sp-core::sr25519` and `sp-core::ed25519` modules to support quantum-safe cryptography.
  - Ensure compatibility with existing Substrate extrinsics.

- [ ] **Hashing Functions**
  - Replace SHA-2/SHA-3 with post-quantum hashing functions such as **SHAKE-256** or **TupleHash/Sponge-based constructions**.
  - Evaluate **Keccak with a larger output size** (512-bit) for quantum resistance.
  - Implement quantum-safe Merkle trees for state proofs and data integrity.

- [ ] **Transaction Broadcasting & Peer Communication**
  - Secure transaction relay and gossip protocols with **lattice-based or post-quantum key exchange (e.g., Kyber, FrodoKEM)**.
  - Ensure peer-to-peer encryption relies on post-quantum TLS (e.g., **NIST PQC KEMs with TLS 1.3**).
  - Implement hybrid encryption (e.g., **Kyber + X25519**) to maintain transitional security.

- [ ] **State Proofs & Finality**
  - Ensure quantum-safe finality proofs in consensus mechanisms.
  - Use **hash-based cryptography** for verifying finality and state commitments.
  - Evaluate **Winternitz One-Time Signatures (WOTS+)** for checkpoint verification.

- [ ] **Auditing & Testing**
  - Perform cryptographic audits to confirm quantum safety.
  - Run testnets with quantum-resistant algorithms and measure performance.
  - Simulate quantum attacks against key cryptographic components.

- [ ] Add a blog section for updates and announcements.

### **3.2 Functionality**
- [ ] Integrate a wallet for users to interact with the blockchain.
- [ ] Add a block explorer to view transactions and blocks.
